# MovApps (Flutter Project)

Hi everybody. How are you guys? May you always be in good health and of course always be blessed by God!

I want to showcase my mobile app project developed with Flutter.

This application actually only contains a movie dashboard view like the Netflix application.

Best regards, @aqshalrzq

### MovApps - About

The application or project this time I named MovApps. My goal for developing this Flutter-based mobile application is to improve my understanding of how to develop and create a program with Flutter.

### MovApps - Technology

For the technology from the MovApps project, I developed it with several components, namely:

- Android Studio
- Flutter v. 2.2.3
- Flutter SDK v. 2.10.0
- [google_fonts](https://pub.dev/packages/google_fonts)
- [carousel_slider](https://pub.dev/packages/carousel_slider)

### MovApps - Credit

For inspiration from working on the MovApps project that I developed, it came from a youtube channel called [doctor code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gt-r9DlM-AE&t=5s) which discusses how to make a mobile application project similar to Netflix.

### MovApps - Open Source

For those of you who want to develop this MovApps application even better, I invite you with a note that your goals are for good. In addition, if you really want to make this application commercial, please contact me.
